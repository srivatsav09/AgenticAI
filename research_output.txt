Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds from the family Spheniscidae () of the order Sphenisciformes (). They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one species, the Galapagos penguin, is found north of the equator. They are highly social animals, often living in large colonies. Penguins feed on fish, krill, and squid, and are known for their distinctive black and white coloring, which serves as camouflage in the sea and on land.
